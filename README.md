# JudgeAssist

JudgeAssist is an ML-powered tool used to assist [streetlifting](https://calisthenics.com/what-is-streetlifting/) judges in evaluating the validity of lifts performed by athletes. Additionally, JudgeAssist can be used to help athletes evaluate their own lifts in training. JudgeAssist uses augmented video replay to help users ensure that proper depth/height requirements have been met during a lift.

## Streetlifting Depth and Height Rules

Currently, the premier international governing body for streetlifting is [FinalRep](https://final-rep.com/). FinalRep has established specifc guidelines for validity of the four competition lifts - muscle up (bar or ring), pull, dip, squat. The full FinalRep rulebook can be found here https://final-rep.com/rulebook. 

Of the four competition lifts, three have explicit requirements for depth/height that the athlete must adhear to - pull, dip, squat. These depth/height rules are as follows:

* __pull__ - the athlete's chin must be visibly above the bar
* __dip__ - the highest point of the back of the athlete's shoulder must be visibly lower than the highest point of the athlete's elbow AND the highest point of the bottom of the dip belt must be at least level with the highest point of the dip handles
* __squat__ - the surfaces of the thighs at the hip joint must be lower than the tops of the knees

These rules can be difficult to evaluate objectively and fairly especially in a live competition environment. Thus, JudgeAssist aims to use augmented video replay to help judges assess each lift.
